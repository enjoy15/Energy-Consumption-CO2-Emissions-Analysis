## Dataset Content

### Data Sources

**Data Sources:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lobosi/c02-emission-by-countrys-grouth-and-population)

### Overview

The world is becoming more modernised by the year, and with this becoming all the more polluted.

This data was pulled from the US Energy Administration and joined together for an easier analysis. Its a collection of some big factors that play into C02 Emissions, with everything from the Production and Consumption of each type of major energy source for each country and its pollution rating each year. It also includes each countries GDP, Population, Energy intensity per capita (person), and Energy intensity per GDP (per person GDP). All the data spans all the way from the 1980's to 2020. 

### Feature Descriptions:

## Business Requirements

### Problem Statement

Climate change represents the defining challenge of our generation, with the energy sector accounting for approximately **73% of global greenhouse gas emissions** (IPCC, 2021) [[1]](#1). Countries worldwide are committed to transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy under the Paris Agreement, aiming to limit global warming to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels.

## Hypothesis and How to Validate

### Hypothesis 1: GDP and Energy Consumption Relationship

**Null Hypothesis (Hâ):** There is no significant relationship between GDP and energy consumption.

**Alternative Hypothesis (Hâ):** There is a significant positive relationship between GDP and energy consumption.

**Rationale:** Economic growth typically requires energy for manufacturing, transportation, and services. Wealthier countries consume more energy.

**Validation Method:**
1. **Pearson Correlation Analysis**
   - Calculate correlation coefficient (r)
   - Test for statistical significance (p-value)
   - Interpret strength of relationship

2. **Linear Regression**
   - Model: Energy_consumption = Î²â + Î²â(GDP) + Îµ

**Expected Result:** Strong positive correlation (r > 0.70, p < 0.05)

**Actual Result:** p < 0.001 â **REJECT Hâ** - Strong positive relationship confirmed

**Business Implication:** Economic growth and energy consumption are tightly coupled. Decoupling requires deliberate energy efficiency policies.

---

### Hypothesis 2: Renewable Energy and CO2 Emissions

**Null Hypothesis (Hâ):** There is no significant difference in CO2 emissions between renewable and fossil fuel energy sources

**Alternative Hypothesis (Hâ):** Fossil fuel energy sources produce significantly higher CO2 emissions than renewable sources

**Rationale:** Renewables (solar, wind, hydro) produce minimal direct CO2 emissions compared to coal, oil, and gas.

**Validation Method:**
1. **Independent T-Test**
   - Group data into renewable energy and fossil fuel categories
   - Compare mean CO2 emissions between groups
   - Test for statistical significance (Î± = 0.05)

**Expected Result:** Significantly lower emissions for renewables (p < 0.05, large effect size)

**Actual Result:** p < 0.001 â **REJECT Hâ** - There is a significant difference in CO2 emissions between energy sources. Fossil fuels produce more CO2 than renewables.

**Business Implication:** Transitioning to renewables is essential for meeting climate targets. 

---

### Hypothesis 3: Energy Consumption Trends Over Time

**Null Hypothesis (Hâ):** Energy consumption has not changed significantly over time

**Alternative Hypothesis (Hâ):** Energy consumption has increased significantly over time

**Rationale:** Over time, factors such as population growth, urbanisation, and economic development typically lead to higher demand for energy. Additionally, increased use of electrical appliances, digital technologies, and transport activity contributes to rising energy consumption. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that total energy consumption has increased significantly over the years, reflecting broader trends in industrialisation and lifestyle changes.

**Validation Method:**
1. **Linear regression analysis**
   - Model: Energy_Consumption = Î²â + Î²â(Year) + Îµ

2. **Trend Analysis**
   - Plot energy consumption over time

**Expected Result:** Significant negative trend (Î²â < 0, p < 0.05)

**Actual Result:** p < 0.001 â **REJECT Hâ** - Energy consumption has INCREASED significantly over time.

**Business Implication:** Need for sustainable energy solutions is urgent.

---

**Overall Conclusion:** All three hypotheses showed statistically significant results (p < 0.001), providing strong evidence for the relationships between economic factors, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. These findings support aggressive renewable energy policies and energy efficiency standards.

## Analysis Techniques Used

This section details the data analysis methods employed, their limitations, alternative approaches, and how generative AI tools assisted in the project.


### 1. Descriptive Statistics

**Techniques Used:**
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of dispersion (standard deviation, variance, IQR)
- Percentiles and quartiles
- Frequency distributions

**Limitations:**
- **Outliers:** Mean is sensitive to extreme values (e.g., China's massive consumption)
- **Distribution Assumptions:** Standard deviation assumes normal distribution (not always true)
- **Temporal Aggregation:** Summary statistics across all years may hide trends

**Alternative Approaches:**
- **Robust Statistics:** Use median and IQR instead of mean and std for skewed data
- **Temporal Stratification:** Calculate statistics separately for each decade
- **Weighted Statistics:** Weight by population or GDP for more representative averages

**Justification for Chosen Approach:**
Descriptive statistics provide a quick overview of data characteristics, essential for initial exploration. Both mean (for normal distributions) and median (for skewed distributions) are used to handle different data types appropriately.

---

### 2. Correlation Analysis

**Techniques Used:**
- Pearson correlation coefficient (linear relationships)
- Correlation heatmaps for multivariate analysis

**Limitations:**
- **Causation:** Correlation does not imply causation (GDP and energy may both be driven by third factor)
- **Linearity Assumption:** Pearson correlation only captures linear relationships
- **Outliers:** Extreme values can inflate or deflate correlation coefficients
- **Temporal Autocorrelation:** Time series data may show spurious correlations

**Alternative Approaches:**
- **Partial Correlation:** Control for confounding variables (e.g., correlation between GDP and energy, controlling for population)
- **Granger Causality:** Test if one time series predicts another (directional relationship)

**Justification for Chosen Approach:**
Pearson correlation is widely understood and appropriate for the predominantly linear relationships in our data. We validated linearity assumptions with scatter plots before calculating correlations.

---

### 3. Linear Regression

**Techniques Used:**
- Simple linear regression (one predictor)

**Limitations:**
- **Linearity Assumption:** Assumes linear relationship between predictors and target (may not hold)
- **Outliers:** Extreme values can disproportionately influence regression line
- **Extrapolation:** Predictions outside training data range are unreliable

**Alternative Approaches:**
- **Polynomial Regression:** Capture non-linear relationships 

**Justification for Chosen Approach:**

- Linear regression is interpretable (coefficients show feature importance) and appropriate for the predominantly linear relationships in our data. 

---

### 4. Time Series Analysis

**Techniques Used:**
- Trend analysis (linear regression with time)
- Year-over-year growth rates

**Limitations:**
- **Stationarity Assumption:** Many time series methods assume stationary data (constant mean/variance)
- **Autocorrelation:** Observations are not independent (violates regression assumptions)
- **Seasonality:** Annual data may hide seasonal patterns (monthly data would be better)

**Alternative Approaches:**
- **Exponential Smoothing:** Weight recent observations more heavily

**Justification for Chosen Approach:**
Simple trend analysis are sufficient for our 40-year annual data. We used linear regression to quantify trends. 

---

### 5. Data Visualisation

**Techniques Used:**
- Static visualisations (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Interactive visualisations (Plotly)
- Dashboard development (PowerBI)

**Limitations:**
- **Overplotting:** Too many data points can obscure patterns
- **Chart Junk:** Unnecessary decorations distract from data
- **3D Charts:** Often misleading and hard to interpret

**Alternative Approaches:**
- **Aggregation:** Group data to reduce overplotting (e.g., show country averages, not individual years)
- **Minimalist Design:** Remove gridlines, borders, and unnecessary elements
- **Small Multiples:** Multiple simple charts instead of one complex chart

**Justification for Chosen Approach:**
 A mix of static (for reports) and interactive (for dashboard) visualisations are used. Static charts are publication-ready, while interactive charts enable exploration. 

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Data Privacy

**Issue:** The dataset contains country-level aggregated data, not individual-level data, so privacy risks are minimal. However, we must consider:

1. **Data Provenance:** Ensure data comes from reputable sources (EIA, World Bank, IEA) with proper data collection protocols
2. **Anonymisation:** No personally identifiable information (PII) is present in the dataset
3. **Consent:** Aggregated national statistics are public domain, no individual consent required

**Conclusion:** No privacy concerns. Dataset is public, aggregated, and anonymised.
