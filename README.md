## Dataset Content

### Data Sources

**Data Sources:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lobosi/c02-emission-by-countrys-grouth-and-population)

### Overview

The world is becoming more modernised by the year, and with this becoming all the more polluted.

This data was pulled from the US Energy Administration and joined together for an easier analysis. Its a collection of some big factors that play into C02 Emissions, with everything from the Production and Consumption of each type of major energy source for each country and its pollution rating each year. It also includes each countries GDP, Population, Energy intensity per capita (person), and Energy intensity per GDP (per person GDP). All the data spans all the way from the 1980's to 2020. 

### Feature Descriptions:
* **Country** - Country in question
* **Energy_type** - Type of energy source
* **Year** - Year the data was recorded
* **Energy_consumption** - Amount of Consumption for the specific energy source, measured (quad Btu)
* **Energy_production** - Amount of Production for the specific energy source, measured (quad Btu)
* **GDP** - Countries GDP at purchasing power parities, measured (Billion 2015$ PPP)
* **Population** - Population of specific Country, measured (Mperson)
* **Energy_intensity_per_capita** - Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy. It is calculated as units of energy per unit of capita (capita = individual person), measured (MMBtu/person)
* **Energy_intensity_by_GDP**- Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy. It is calculated as units of energy per unit of GDP, measred (1000 Btu/2015$ GDP PPP)
* **CO2_emission** - The amount of C02 emitted, measured (MMtonnes CO2)

## Business Requirements

### Problem Statement

Climate change represents the defining challenge of our generation, with the energy sector accounting for approximately **73% of global greenhouse gas emissions** (IPCC, 2021) [[1]](#1). Countries worldwide are committed to transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy under the Paris Agreement, aiming to limit global warming to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels.

However, policymakers, energy planners, and climate researchers face significant challenges:

1. **Lack of Accessible Historical Data** - Energy data is scattered across multiple sources and difficult to analyse
2. **Complex Relationships** - Understanding connections between economic growth, population, and energy consumption requires sophisticated analysis
3. **Limited Predictive Tools** - Few tools exist to forecast future energy scenarios based on historical trends
4. **Communication Barriers** - Technical data is difficult to communicate to non-technical stakeholders
5. **Benchmarking Challenges** - Countries struggle to compare their progress against peers

## Hypothesis and How to Validate

### Hypothesis 1: GDP and Energy Consumption Relationship

**Null Hypothesis (Hâ):** There is no significant relationship between GDP and energy consumption.

**Alternative Hypothesis (Hâ):** There is a significant positive relationship between GDP and energy consumption.

**Rationale:** Economic growth typically requires energy for manufacturing, transportation, and services. Wealthier countries consume more energy.

**Validation Method:**
1. **Pearson Correlation Analysis**
   - Calculate correlation coefficient (r)
   - Test for statistical significance (p-value)
   - Interpret strength of relationship

2. **Linear Regression**
   - Model: Energy_consumption = Î²â + Î²â(GDP) + Îµ

**Expected Result:** Strong positive correlation (r > 0.70, p < 0.05)

**Actual Result:** p < 0.001 â **REJECT Hâ** - Strong positive relationship confirmed

**Business Implication:** Economic growth and energy consumption are tightly coupled. Decoupling requires deliberate energy efficiency policies.

---

### Hypothesis 2: Renewable Energy and CO2 Emissions

**Null Hypothesis (Hâ):** There is no significant difference in CO2 emissions between renewable and fossil fuel energy sources

**Alternative Hypothesis (Hâ):** Fossil fuel energy sources produce significantly higher CO2 emissions than renewable sources

**Rationale:** Renewables (solar, wind, hydro) produce minimal direct CO2 emissions compared to coal, oil, and gas.

**Validation Method:**
1. **Independent T-Test**
   - Group data into renewable energy and fossil fuel categories
   - Compare mean CO2 emissions between groups
   - Test for statistical significance (Î± = 0.05)

**Expected Result:** Significantly lower emissions for renewables (p < 0.05, large effect size)

**Actual Result:** p < 0.001 â **REJECT Hâ** - There is a significant difference in CO2 emissions between energy sources. Fossil fuels produce more CO2 than renewables.

**Business Implication:** Transitioning to renewables is essential for meeting climate targets. 

---

### Hypothesis 3: Energy Consumption Trends Over Time

**Null Hypothesis (Hâ):** Energy consumption has not changed significantly over time

**Alternative Hypothesis (Hâ):** Energy consumption has increased significantly over time

**Rationale:** Over time, factors such as population growth, urbanisation, and economic development typically lead to higher demand for energy. Additionally, increased use of electrical appliances, digital technologies, and transport activity contributes to rising energy consumption. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that total energy consumption has increased significantly over the years, reflecting broader trends in industrialisation and lifestyle changes.

**Validation Method:**
1. **Linear regression analysis**
   - Model: Energy_Consumption = Î²â + Î²â(Year) + Îµ

2. **Trend Analysis**
   - Plot energy consumption over time

**Expected Result:** Significant negative trend (Î²â < 0, p < 0.05)

**Actual Result:** p < 0.001 â **REJECT Hâ** - Energy consumption has INCREASED significantly over time.

**Business Implication:** Need for sustainable energy solutions is urgent.

---

**Overall Conclusion:** All three hypotheses showed statistically significant results (p < 0.001), providing strong evidence for the relationships between economic factors, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. These findings support aggressive renewable energy policies and energy efficiency standards.
